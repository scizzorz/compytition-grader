# Compytition Grader

Automatic grading component of [Compytition](https://github.com/scizzorz/compytition).

# Notes

The automatic grading system (hereafter "autograder"), aims to be fully C and
POSIX compliant where possible. Although all efforts have been made to sandbox
this daemon as much as possible, you should still run it inside a VM or on a
system that is of no importance.
